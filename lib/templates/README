This is the README for the <%= @project_name %> project.

Compilation
-----------
<%= @project_name %> has been created using fluby, so compilation is pretty straightforward:

    $ cd <%= @project_name %>
    $ rake

There are some additional rake tasks available:
<% if RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /mswin32/ %>
<%= %x(cmd.exe /c rake -f "#{@project_folder}/Rakefile" -T -s) %>
<% else %>
<%= %x(rake -f "#{@project_folder}/Rakefile" -T -s) %>
<% end %>

Assets
------
When compiling, fluby imports all assets in the 'assets' directory.

PNG files are imported as MovieClips, with their name (minus extension) as an ID. Thus, if you have a 'background.png' file, you can use it on your code with:

    var my_clip = attachMovie("background","my_clip_name",1);

TTF fonts are also imported. If you need to use multiple weights of the same family (i.e: regular, bold, italics...) you should name your fonts like this:

    family_name-font_weight.ttf

So, if you were to use Arial, you'd use:

    arial-regular.ttf
    arial-bold.ttf
    arial-italic.ttf
    arial-bold_italic.ttf

Then, in your code, you'd use the fonts like this:

    createTextField("txtest",1,0,0,200,30);
    txtest.embedFonts = true;
    var tf = new TextFormat();
    tf.font = "arial";
    tf.italic = true;
    txtest.setNewTextFormat(tf);
    txtest.text = "This is italics";
