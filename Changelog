0.X.X
-----
* Support for user templates

0.6.4
-----
* Added 'rake monitor' task to fluby project, so the project autocompiles whenever you save the main .as file or any of the auxiliary files (index.rhtml, project.rxml or Rakefile)
* Added :assets task to fluby Rakefile. js and xml files in the 'assets' folder are copied to the 'deploy' folder when compiling.
* Run 'pack' task when running 'rake release'
* Create swfobject.js in 'assets' folder instead of 'deploy'
* Added Video asset to the rxml template. It's commented out in case you don't need it, but it's nice to have it there as I always forget the syntax :)
* Use packed swfobject.js

0.6.1
-----
* Added 'delegate' template for script/generate

0.6
---

0.5.6
-----

* Improved documentation (just a little bit :)
